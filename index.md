**Welcome, members of Local 549**

With the fourth wave of the COVID-19 crisis upon us, many employers in Ontario have been developing workplace policies calling for mandatory vaccines and testing. The Ford government has also announced a vaccine passport will be brought in this month.

As members continue to navigate these challenging times and, in many cases, plan their own return to the traditional workplace, they have asked OPSEU/SEFPO about these policies, and their impact on workersâ€™ personal health choices and working conditions.

Here are some of the most commonly-asked questions and answers about mandatory vaccinations: [Answers to members questions about mandatory vaccinations](https://opseu.org/news/frequently-asked-questions-about-mandatory-vaccinations/132444/)
