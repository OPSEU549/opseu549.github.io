**Welcome, members of Local 549**

With the fourth wave of the COVID-19 crisis upon us, many employers in Ontario have been developing workplace policies calling for mandatory vaccines and testing. The Ford government has also announced a vaccine passport will be brought in this month.

As members continue to navigate these challenging times and, in many cases, plan their own return to the traditional workplace, they have asked OPSEU/SEFPO about these policies, and their impact on workers’ personal health choices and working conditions.

Here are some of the most commonly-asked questions and answers about mandatory vaccinations: [Answers to members questions about mandatory vaccinations](https://opseu.org/news/frequently-asked-questions-about-mandatory-vaccinations/132444/)

**Orange Shirt Day - National Day for Truth & Reconciliaton, September 30th**

The OPSEU/SEFPO Indigenous Circle will be hosting a virtual forum to commemorate Orange Shirt Day and the first National Day for Truth and Reconciliation. This event will honour the survivors of the residential school system including those who did not make it home.

Join us on September 27 to reflect, remember and recognize the ongoing effects of intergenerational trauma.  We will also pay respect to the souls that continue to be uncovered and recommit ourselves to our responsibility to truth and reconciliation.

*When: Monday, September 27th, 2021*

*Time: 6:00pm – 7:30pm*

Location: on Zoom (a link will be provided after you register)

For any questions or to register, please contact equity@opseu.org with your name and union number.

The deadline to register is Sunday, September 26th, 2021.

**What action can I take in my life for Truth and Reconcilation?**

Senator Murray Sinclair, Commissioner of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, issued a challenge to all Canadians, saying: “My challenge to you is to read the **[94 Calls to Action of the Truth and Reconciliation Report](https://trk.mmail.lst.fin.gov.on.ca/trk/click?ref=zr9uf3m5h_3-8368x3ed50x055903&)** and pick one that you can work on, that you understand - and make it happen. This is not a spectator sport. We need you, in order to bring reconciliation to a reality in this country.”
