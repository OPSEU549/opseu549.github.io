*Sunday, March 22, 2020 - day 9 of the science centre closure*

**Welcome, members of Local 549**

How quickly times change!  We are all struggling to find ways to cope with this new situation. And some of us are struggling more: 
- All food service workers have been laid off. Compass, the company that runs our cafeteria and food services, emailed the temporary lay-off notices on March 14.
- Almost all cleaners haven bee laid off. Eurest, the company that is in charge of cleaning the premises of the Ontario Science Centre, notified their staff on March 16.

If you have ideas on how to help, please post them to our [OPSEU Local 549 Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/638743390217436/). A place for us to communicate and coordinate our efforts.
