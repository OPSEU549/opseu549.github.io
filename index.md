**Poll: Most Ontarians want the Ontario Science Centre to re-open and remain where it is

September 2024

The message from Ontarians is loud and clear: The Ontario Science Centre should stay where it is in Don Mills. A new poll commissioned by OPSEU/SEFPO Local 549 found that a substantial majority (72%) of Ontarians in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area want the Science Centre’s current building to be reopened immediately and repaired, citing it as in the best interest of all Ontarians.

**Union Statement on Ontario Science Centre Closure**

June 2024

Our staff are devastated and outraged by the abrupt decision to close the Ontario Science Centre at 770 Don Mills Road. This cherished institution, a community cornerstone for over 50 years, is more than just a workplace; it’s a second home for many of us. 

This sudden closure has left us feeling betrayed, and we demand transparency about the structural issues cited. We call for open communication and concrete plans to ensure job security for all staff. 

The Ontario Science Centre’s impact on families and students is profound, and we are committed to fighting for its future at its current location. We are grateful for the huge outpouring of public support from all corners of Ontario to re-open the building immediately, fix the roof, and keep the Science Centre in its current location for good.

Our resolve is strong. We will not let this cherished institution be dismantled without a fight. We urge all stakeholders to join us in preserving this vital community resource.
