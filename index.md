**OPSEU announces tentative agreement for a new contract**

Our representatives have successfully negotiated a new contract (aka the Collective Agreement) with the province. In January, you will be invited to vote whether you accept it, and if a majority of members does, it will become our new contract for the next three years. Link to press release: https://opseu.org/.../opseu-sefpo-announces.../140580/.

Here are two paragraphs that describe the improvements:

*Along with the annual one per cent wage increase, the deal also includes increases to paramedical benefits and a healthcare spending account. Other non-monetary improvements include seniority calculations for fixed-term employees, and job security language.*

*The parties also agreed on new language that will allow the Diversity and Inclusion Committee to perform its review of the OPS Unified Collective Agreement under an equity lens, to help identify systemic barriers and changes needed within the agreement.*

**Frequently asked questions about mandatory COVID-19 vaccination/testing**

With the fourth wave of the COVID-19 crisis upon us, many employers in Ontario have been developing workplace policies calling for mandatory vaccines and testing. The Ford government has also announced a vaccine passport will be brought in this month.

As members continue to navigate these challenging times and, in many cases, plan their own return to the traditional workplace, they have asked OPSEU/SEFPO about these policies, and their impact on workersâ€™ personal health choices and working conditions.

Here are some of the most commonly-asked questions and answers about mandatory vaccinations: [Answers to members questions about mandatory vaccinations](https://opseu.org/news/frequently-asked-questions-about-mandatory-vaccinations/132444/)
