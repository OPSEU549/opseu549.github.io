Welcome!

How quickly times change!  We are all struggling to find ways to cope with this new situation. And some of us are struggling more: 
- All food service workers have been laid off. Compass, the company that runs our cafeteria and food services, emailed the tlay-off notices on March 14.
- Almost all cleaners haven bee laid off. Eurest, the company that is in charge of cleaning the premises of the Ontario Science Centre, has laid off almost all workers





















- The [OPSEU Local 549 Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/638743390217436/). A place for us to communicate and coordinate our efforts. Click on the "+ Join Group" button to apply - only OPSEU members will be granted access. 

- ["The Collective Agreement"](https://opseu.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/2015-2017_opseu_central_unified_agreement_-_final.pdf) is our work contract. It spells out the working condidtions, benefits and salaries. It was extended in 2018 and [some additional aspects were added](https://opseu.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-2021_ops_unified_extension_agreement.pdf). Our salaries are listed in a [separate document](https://opseu.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/copy_of_opseu_salary_schedule_2017-2021_unified_send.pdf).

- The [owner's manual](https://opseu.org/information/owners-manual/12067/) gives a detailed overview of how OPSEU is organized.

- The [OPSEU constitution](https://opseu.org/information/tools-and-resources/ontario-public-service-employees-union-constitution-2019/92827/) describes in detail how OPSEU is organized.

- ["inSolidarity"](https://opseu.org/solidarity/) - The OPSEU newsletter

- ["OPSEU Powertool"](https://opseu.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/2015-04_en_powertool.pdf) - a comprehensive resource meant for stewards, but useful for anyone interested in how to get things done at the local. 

- OPSEU organizes a [range of events](https://opseu.org/events/). Look for "educationals" of Region 5 - they are trainings that are available to all of us.

- OPSEU is divided into regions. We are part of region 5. Each region has its own offices and employs staff to help the locals. Currently our staff representative is Christine Laverty.
