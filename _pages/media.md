On June 21, when the rushed closure was announced and carried out, OPSEU/SEFPO President JP Hornick and leaders of Local 549 met with the employer and with members, and released this statement: [Ford government neglect allows Ontario Science Centre to crumble.](https://opseu.org/news/ford-government-neglect-allows-ontario-science-centre-to-crumble/230029/)

[Ontario Science Centre layoffs imminent due to unnecessary closure to the public.](https://opseu.org/news/ontario-science-centre-layoffs-imminent-due-to-unnecessary-closure-to-the-public/231895/)
